Game Description:
BadlandsCaves is a custom Minecraft Survival-type Gamemode. You spawn underground in a cave where all water is poisonous. There are no signs of life around you, and all you have is a sapling and some bone meal. Moving around too much will not only make you hungry, but thirsty as well. Dying causes you to respawn with worse and worse debuffs. As your civilization progresses, you can walk down the road of magic, or the road of technology. Survive, and kill the Ender Dragon.
